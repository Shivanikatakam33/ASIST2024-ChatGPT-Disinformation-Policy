## Overview
This project explores the use of **ChatGPT** for the **automatic analysis of disinformation policy documents**, employing **zero-shot** and **few-shot learning strategies** through prompt engineering. The study aims to address three primary research questions:
1. Can ChatGPT effectively analyze policy documents?
2. How can prompts be optimized for better automatic policy understanding?
3. What practices improve ChatGPT’s performance in policy content analysis?


A subset of the 37 policy documents or sample documents (if public sharing of the original documents is restricted).
Processed data used for zero-shot and few-shot experiments.


P1 to P2: Zero-shot learning prompts.
P3 to P6: Few-shot learning with expert definitions, annotated data, and ChatGPT-generated unique aspects.

Evaluation metrics and results (accuracy, F-score) for the different experiments (tabular data as presented in the paper).
